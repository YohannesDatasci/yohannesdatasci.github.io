the logic behind the algorithm is the following<br>

The input parameters are, epsilon, minpts and distance_measure<br>

Step 1: pick a random unvisited point p from the input data<br>
Step 2: Check if there are at least minpts number of points in the epsilon  neighborhood of p<br>
Step 3: If not, then mark p as noise else ExpandCluster(p)<br>

The ExpandCluster functon has the following logic<br>

Step 1: add point p to cluster c<br>
Step 2: iterate over all neighouring points of p<br>
Step 3: for each neighbouring point check if there are at least minpts number of points in epsilon neighborhood<br>
Step 4: If yes, then add the neighbouring points of the p' to the neighbouring points of p<br>
Step 4: add neighbouring points to the cluster c<br>

The advantages of DBSCAN is its speed, ability to capture robust shapes of clusters, robustness to outliers<br><br>

The disadvatnage of DBSCAN is the inability to cluster datasets with varying density<br>

To address these issues the following algorithms have been developed<br>

<img src="images/optics_pseudocode.png"><br>
OPTICS is an algorithm that tries to solve this issue<br>
It introduces two new cocncepts the core-distance and reachability<br>

core-distance is the minimum epsilon for which the given core will include minpts number of points<br>
reachability is the max between euclidean distance to the point q and core-distance for give the point p.<br>

The logic of the algorithm is to produce a hierarchical reachability structure for all the give points in priority order.<br>

OPTICS itself is not a clustering algoirthm, but it can be converted to so by selecting a treshold value for the hierarchical reachability structure.<br>

The weakness of OPTICS is that it is too computationaly heavy and does not scale for big data.<br>

The HDBSCAN came to rescue this situation<br>
